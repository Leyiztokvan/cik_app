## Overview

**Çik**, an interactive template for a mobile e-commerce app, was built using `Flutter` and `Dart`. The template is designed to include essential components and features of a typical e-commerce app —  such as the homepage, product listing, and product details screens. 
This template serves as a foundation for building various e-commerce applications.

***Note**: The template is no longer available for download, and there are currently no plans to publish it.*

## Naming & Logo

**Çik** is a name derived from the Kurdish word **Çîk**, meaning **something** or **thing** — *a general object or unspecified item, it could be anything*.

The name is chosen to symbolise and show how any idea can be shaped into a tangible ***thing*** — in this case, an application.


**About the Logo:**
<table>
    <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 60%;">
        <strong>Puzzle pieces</strong> represent modularity, reusability, and seamless integration of a flexible design and its components.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Encircling line and circles</strong> symbolize the development journey and lifecycle of a project.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Open gap in surrounding line</strong> represents the possibility of easy modification and expansion.

## Motivation

This project was driven by curiosity and a desire for self-directed learning. My goals included:
- Learn and gain hands-on experience in programming
- Understand and learn the principles of software development
- Explore design principles and concepts
- Make the transformation of an idea into a product (app) easy and seamless
- Document and share the process to enable, inspire, and guide other beginners to realise their own ideas
- Develop a product by myself, driven by personal ambition


## Roadmap
Here is a brief overview of the milestones:
- Research and choose appropriate tools
- Learn `Dart` and `Flutter` by building a simple flashlight app -> [**Cöcu**](https://github.com/Leyiztokvan/coecu_app)
- Test and publish the flashlight app on the Play Store
- Study UI/UX design principles 
- Design the interface and user flow for **Çik**
- Develop and prototype the app template
- Publish a first version of **Çik** on the Play Store
