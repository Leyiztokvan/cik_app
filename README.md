## Project Overview

As part of this project, an interactive mobile app template for an "e-commerce" app for smartphones was created in "Flutter", a UI development kit from Google, which uses the "Dart" programming language for the development of cross-platform apps.
The app template is intended to contain the basic building blocks and functions of an e-commerce app, such as the homepage and product information page. This template will later serve as a template for the creation of various e-commerce applications.

**Note**: The application is not available for download anymore. There are no plans for publishing the app for the time being.

## Naming and Logo
###### Çik
Kurdish word for **Thing**, it could be anything. Chosen as a name to symbolise and show that any idea can be created and realised into ***Thing***, in this case in an application.

###### Logo
- The **puzzle pieces** represent the modularity, reusability and seamless integration of a flexible design and its components. 
- The **encircling line and circles** represent the process of creating this ***Çik***, this ***thing*** and maintenance of it during its existence.
- The **open area in the surrounding line** represents the possibility of easy modification and expansion.


## Motivation

- Learn programming
- Learn about software development
- Learn about design 
- Developing a product by myself for my own ambition
- Making the transformation of an idea into a product/application easy and seamless
- Documenting the process to enable other interested beginners to realise their own ideas


## Roadmap
Here is a brief overview of the milestones:
- Research which tools to use
- Learning Dart and Flutter by starting with the creation of a flash light app (see app here [Cöcu](https://github.com/Leyiztokvan/coecu_app))
- Test and publish the created flash light app in the Play Store
- Learn design concepts 
- Plan and create the UI and UX
- Develop **Çik**
- Publish **Çik** in the Play Store
